Hi Brandan,

Good morning! Hope you're doing great!

Lesson 1 is locked down and ready for you to record. Please find attached the same.

Please record only exercise 1 as a sample. I will review it and provide feedback accordingly. 

You can find the codes uploaded here: https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-Android-Workshop/tree/master/Chapter01

Request you to please review the exercises along with the codes first. If you find any discrepancies, please email me the same. I will take it up with the concerned team.

Once done recording, place the video here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1VXWD8M72ZN8kJMk2UEzqwsuF90hgwPqv

Kindly note the below guidelines while recording an exercise:
The exercises and activities will be standalone ones meaning that it should in itself be self-explanatory about the concepts that it covers.
These exercises should not be referred with number but just names and you should not refer to any other exercise in the book while recording any particular exercise. 
Avoid calling out exercise numbers on screen too.
The notebook should not be pre-loaded. All code cells should be executed while explaining each cell

Secondly, every exercise should be divided into three parts: 

Introduction (Include name of the exercise, reference/one-line explanation of the concepts covered, exercise objective)
Exercise Body (The main exercise and its steps, codes, any note/caution/tip for the exercise)
Summary (Exercise summary or what new was learned in the exercise)

Lastly, this will be a guided learning course, so the tone should be that of an enthusiastic instructor. For other technical details, please refer to the video recording guidelines shared earlier.


In addition to this, I have also provided sample videos here.


Let me know if you have queries regarding this.



It would be great if you could share exercise 1 by 17th June.
