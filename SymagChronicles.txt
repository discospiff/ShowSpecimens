Story Time: Meeting in the Ladies Room
The Symag Chronicles, Part 3
--
I started to get the hang of flying to Europe, and my favorite flight was 228, the CVG-Paris nonstop.  Seat 21 A has the most legroom in coach, and I almost always got that seat.  
Even with all of the legroom, I could never fall alseep on that 9 hour flight.  Not a wink.  Until it landed in CDG, and the moment I stepped off the aircraft, the fatigue would all hit me at once.
I was barely functional, and I went to the Air France lounge.  I went to the restroom.  In France, most toilets are in completely sealed off compartments with a door - essentially a separate room.  I went to one of the compartments, shut the door, and without lifting the lid, sat on the toilet.  Next thing I knew, I woke up and it was 45 minutes later.  
Still a bit fatigued, I decided to go into the lounge.  I opened the door to the toilet, and saw a woman looking at me funny.  That's not strange, because in France, women clean the Mens rooms, and men clean the Womens rooms, while the restrooms are still in use.  But what was weird were the other 13 or so women staring at me.
Oh damn.  I just took a nap in the Women's restroom, by mistake.
